---

Recently, [Karan](https://arcsoft.uvic.ca/team/karan-gosal/) and I had the opportunity to work
on a passion project, not related to the work we do with ARCsoft. Doing so
gave us the chance to use some of the more mainstream web development tools
that we wouldn't typically use in our day-to-day work. This experience was
both enriching and fulfilling, so I wanted to share some of the key
differences we noticed between the tools we use at ARCsoft and the more
mainstream ones used in the industry. Let's dive in!

## ARCsoft technology stack

At ARCsoft, we primarily use the following technologies:

- **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** for both our backend and frontend,
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** for our frontend styling, and
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** for our database

### Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. It is known as a "batteries-included" framework,
meaning it comes with many built-in features that make it easy to get started.
We chose Django specifically because of its long-standing reliability and
extensive use in the industry.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework aimed at responsive,
mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based
design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other
interface components. Bootstrap was chosen due to its long history of use and
its effectiveness in quickly creating responsive designs.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known
for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It is widely used in the
industry and is known for its support of advanced features such as full-text
search, JSONB data type, and custom extensions.

## Passion project technology stack

For our passion project, we decided to use the following technologies:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
  for the frontend and backend,
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for styling,
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** for UI components,
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** for database management, including authentication, and
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** for deployment

These tools are mainstream in the web development industry and are widely used
by developers around the world, from startups to large enterprises.

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side
rendering (SSR) and generating static websites. It is a popular choice for
building modern web applications and comes with many built-in features that
make development easier, such as:

- Support for both server- and client-side rendering,
- Dynamic HTML streaming,
- Built-in optimizations for production builds, and
- API routes for serverless functions

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language,
making it easier to catch errors and write more maintainable code as your
project grows. It is widely used in the industry and is known for its ability
to scale with large codebases.

### TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom
designs without writing any CSS. It is highly customizable and easy to use,
making it a popular choice for many developers. TailwindCSS is known for its
flexibility and speed in creating responsive designs.

### shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui is a library of UI components built on top of Radix UI, which
provides a set of primitives for building design systems, and styled with
TailwindCSS for easy customization. shadcn/ui offers a wide range of
components, including buttons, modals, and forms, that can be easily
integrated into your project.

### Supabase

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that offers a suite of
tools for building web applications, including:

- Real-time database,
- Authentication, and
- File storage

Supabase is known for its ease of use and flexibility, making it a popular
choice for developers who want to quickly build and deploy applications
without complex infrastructure. Its extensive and user-friendly documentation
makes it easy to get started, and the online dashboard provides an intuitive
interface for managing data.

In addition, Supabase supports `pgvector`, a PostgreSQL extension that enables
vector similarity search. This feature is particularly useful for building
recommendation systems and other machine learning applications, making
Supabase a powerful tool for developers working on data-intensive projects.

### Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, enabling
developers to deploy their applications effortlessly. It integrates seamlessly
with Git repositories, automatically deploying changes whenever you push to
your branch. This continuous deployment feature allows for rapid iteration
and immediate visibility of changes.

Vercel also offers features like custom domains, SSL certificates, and
environment variables, simplifying the process of configuring applications for
production use. The platform is user-friendly and provides detailed analytics
on deployments, allowing developers to track their application's performance
and usage. Additionally, Vercel offers an easy alternative to AWS's Route 53
for DNS management, further streamlining the deployment process.

## Key differences

### Development speed

One of the key differences we noticed between the tools we use at ARCsoft and
the mainstream tools we used for our passion project was the development
speed. The mainstream tools, such as Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS,
allowed us to build and iterate on our project much faster than our usual
tools. The built-in features of Next.js, such as server-side rendering and hot
reloading, made development more efficient, and the utility-first approach of
TailwindCSS enabled us to create custom designs quickly without writing any
CSS.

### Maintenance

Another difference we noticed was the ease of maintenance of the mainstream
tools compared to our usual tools. TypeScript's static typing made it easier
to catch errors and write more maintainable code, while the extensive
documentation of Supabase and Vercel provided clear guidance on how to use
their features. The online dashboard of Supabase and the detailed analytics of
Vercel made it easy to manage and monitor our application, simplifying the
maintenance process.

### Flexibility

While our usual tools at ARCsoft are reliable and widely used in the industry,
the mainstream tools we used for our passion project offered greater
flexibility and customization options. Next.js with TypeScript allowed us to
build modern web applications with ease, and TailwindCSS's utility-first
approach enabled us to create custom designs without writing any CSS. The
extensive library of UI components in shadcn/ui and the support for real-time
data, and `pgvector` in Supabase provided additional flexibility for building
data-intensive applications.

### Deployment

The deployment process was another area where we noticed a significant
difference between the tools we use at ARCsoft and the mainstream tools we
used for our passion project. Vercel's seamless integration with Git
repositories and continuous deployment feature made it easy to deploy changes
and track their performance. The platform's user-friendly interface and
detailed analytics provided visibility into our application's usage and
allowed us to configure it for production use effortlessly.

### Ecosystem and community

The mainstream tools often have larger ecosystems and more active communities
compared to some of the tools we use at ARCsoft. For example, the React
ecosystem that Next.js is part of offers a vast array of libraries, plugins,
and community support, making it easier to find solutions and resources.
Similarly, TailwindCSS has a strong community with numerous resources, themes,
and plugins available, which can significantly speed up development.

### Modern practices and features

The mainstream tools tend to incorporate the latest web development practices
and features. For example, Next.js supports modern JavaScript features and
techniques such as server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation
(SSG), which can improve performance and SEO. TypeScript brings modern
development practices with its static typing and advanced IDE support,
enhancing code quality and maintainability.

## Where Django Excels

### Integrated approach

Django's integrated approach, where it provides a consistent set of tools and
conventions, is a major strength. This "batteries-included" philosophy ensures
that developers have everything they need to build robust applications without
needing to integrate multiple external libraries. This can reduce the overhead
of making technology choices and ensure a cohesive development experience.

### Admin interface

One of Django's standout features is its built-in admin interface. This
automatically generated interface allows for quick and easy management of
application data without the need to build custom admin pages. It's a
significant time-saver for internal tools and content management.

### Security

Django places a strong emphasis on security, providing built-in protections
against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting
(XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This focus on security makes it
a reliable choice for applications where data security is a priority.

### ORM and database flexibility

Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system is robust and allows for
complex queries and database operations using Python code. This makes it
easier to work with databases and can speed up development. Additionally,
Django's support for multiple database backends and its ability to switch
databases with minimal changes is a valuable feature.

### Scalability

While Django might not have the same modern tooling as some newer frameworks,
it has proven scalability. Many large-scale applications use Django
successfully, benefiting from its mature ecosystem, extensive documentation,
and a wide array of third-party packages.

## Conclusion

Our experience working on a passion project with mainstream web development
tools was enlightening and provided valuable insights into the differences
between the tools we use at ARCsoft and the more mainstream ones used in the
industry. While our usual tools are reliable and widely used, the mainstream
tools offered greater development speed, flexibility, and modern practices.

However, Django's integrated approach, built-in admin interface, strong focus
on security, and robust ORM system make it a powerful choice for many
applications, particularly those requiring complex database operations and
secure handling of data. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of
different tools, we can make informed decisions on the best technology stack
for each project.

Overall, this experience has broadened our perspective and provided us with
new tools and techniques that we can apply to our work at ARCsoft. We look
forward to continuing to explore and learn from the ever-evolving world of web
development!
